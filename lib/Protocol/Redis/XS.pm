=head1 NAME

Protocol::Redis::XS - hiredis based parser compatible with Protocol::Redis

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Protocol::Redis::XS;
  my $redis = Protocol::Redis::XS->new;
  $redis->parse("+OK\r\n");
  $redis->get_message;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides a fast parser for the Redis protocol using the code from
L<hiredis|http://github.com/antirez/hiredis> and with API compatibility with
L<Protocol::Redis>.

(If you've found yourself here just looking to use Redis in Perl: This is a low
level parsing module, you probably want to look at the modules mentioned in
L</SEE ALSO> first.)

=head1 METHODS

As per L<Protocol::Redis>, API version 1.

=head2 parse($string)

Parse a chunk of data (calls L</on_message> callback if defined and a complete
message is received).

=head2 get_message

Return a message. This is a potentially nested data structure, for example as
follows:

  {
    type => '*',
    data => [
      {
        type => '$',
        data => 'hello'
      }
    ]
  }

=head2 on_message

Set callback for L</parse>.

=head1 THREADS

This module will work on a threaded perl and will work with threads, however
instances of Protcol::Redis should not be shared between threads.

=head1 SUPPORT

=head2 IRC

L<#redis on irc.perl.org|irc://irc.perl.org/redis>

=head1 DEVELOPMENT

See github: L<https://github.com/dgl/protocol-redis-xs>.

Developer note, hiredis is pulled in via a git submodule, run:

 git submodule update --init

to make the development version buildable.
